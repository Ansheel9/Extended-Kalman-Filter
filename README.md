## Introduction

In this project we will utilize a kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. 

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO. Please see the uWebSocketIO Starter Guide page in the classroom within the EKF Project lesson for the required version and installation scripts.

INPUT: values provided by the simulator to the c++ program
["sensor_measurement"] => the measurement that the simulator observed (either lidar or radar)

OUTPUT: values provided by the c++ program to the simulator
["estimate_x"] <= kalman filter estimated position x
["estimate_y"] <= kalman filter estimated position y
["rmse_x"]
["rmse_y"]
["rmse_vx"]
["rmse_vy"]

## Other Important Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.5
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make` 
   * On windows, you may need to run: `cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" && make`
4. Run it: `./ExtendedKF `

## Generating Additional Data

If you'd like to generate your own radar and lidar data, see the
[utilities repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Mercedes-SF-Utilities) for
Matlab scripts that can generate additional data.

## Result

![result_img](https://github.com/Ansheel9/Extended-Kalman-Filter/blob/master/Result_P5.PNG)

RMSE -> [.0974, .0855, 0.4517, 0.4404].
